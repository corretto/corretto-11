// OopStorage supports management of off-heap references to objects allocated
// in the Java heap.  An OopStorage object provides a set of Java object
// references (oop values), which clients refer to via oop* handles to the
// associated OopStorage entries.  Clients allocate entries to create a
// (possibly weak) reference to a Java object, use that reference, and release
// the reference when no longer needed.
//
// The garbage collector must know about all OopStorage objects and their
// reference strength.  OopStorage provides the garbage collector with support
// for iteration over all the allocated entries.
//
// There are several categories of interaction with an OopStorage object.
//
// (1) allocation and release of entries, by the mutator or the VM.
// (2) iteration by the garbage collector, possibly concurrent with mutator.
// (3) iteration by other, non-GC, tools (only at safepoints).
// (4) cleanup of unused internal storage, possibly concurrent with mutator.
//
// A goal of OopStorage is to make these interactions thread-safe, while
// minimizing potential lock contention issues within and between these
// categories.  In particular, support for concurrent iteration by the garbage
// collector, under certain restrictions, is required.  Further, it must not
// block nor be blocked by other operations for long periods.
//
// Internally, OopStorage is a set of Block objects, from which entries are
// allocated and released.  A block contains an oop[] and a bitmask indicating
// which entries are in use (have been allocated and not yet released).  New
// blocks are constructed and added to the storage object when an entry
// allocation request is made and there are no blocks with unused entries.
// Blocks may be removed and deleted when empty.
//
// There are two important (and somewhat intertwined) protocols governing
// concurrent access to a storage object.  These are the Concurrent Iteration
// Protocol and the Allocation Protocol.  See the ParState class for a
// discussion of concurrent iteration and the management of thread
// interactions for this protocol.  Similarly, see the allocate() function for
// a discussion of allocation.
